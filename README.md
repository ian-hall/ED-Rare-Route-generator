# ED-Rare-Route-generator

Just a python program that uses the spreadsheet 
found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Zv55yEjVdHrNzkH7BPnTCtXRs8GDHqchYjo9Svkyh4/pubhtml">here</a> to
generate some possible rare trade routes. Uses genetic algorithms to calculate these routes. 

I still have a lot of work to do on this as it is:
<ul>
  <li>
  Update the fitness value for route orders to take into account odd/even length routes
  </li>
  <li>
  Better quantify the fitness value of route orders, currently there is only small variations between the values of good routes
  </li>
  <li>
  Whatever other TODO comments I have
  </li>
